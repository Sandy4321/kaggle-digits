Paul Mineiro's cosplay for Kaggle digits
========================================

Paul Mineiro provided some [kernel approximation code](http://www.machinedlearnings.com/2013/08/cosplay.html) for use with MNIST. Here's both the original and a version modified to output predictions for the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition](http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer), which is also based on MNIST.

As mentioned in the article, you'll need [Maxent and L-BFGS](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~weinman/code/) for the logistic regression part.

Accuracy on Digits is similar to accuracy on MNIST: around 97,7%.
